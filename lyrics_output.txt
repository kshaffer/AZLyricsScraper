On the city streets, I got the tunes in my pocket
I'll play the Chili Pepper so the public can rock
Excuse me mister, won't you hear my thought?
I play in a band, yeah, we're called the Red Hots
While I'm away, boy, I'm afraid not
I've got no time to flick and talk
But this baby rocked out on the spot
She was a shakin' and a kickin' and that did a bit of tot
Her pop said no, but I just couldn't stop
The killer had a case of tod the rock

But here's a funky fact that I know is real,
The Red Hots have baby appeal
They dig a funky speil, they'll make some speil
I say the Peppers have baby appeal
The funk mobile is the one we wheel
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal
We serve those tots in the funk mobile
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal

We stop the fire, we quench the heat
We groove the buttocks walking out in the street
'cos that's when in the store when who do we meet?
On a hop skip jump up a baby beat
She was a shakin' and a kickin' those itty bitty feet
The next thing you know was she got out of her bleat
Five thousand babies walkin' out in the street
Well, that's a serious sight for me and golly gee wizz!
I just can't tell ya how much we did

Rockin' right out for those itty bitty girls, right out

But here's a funky fact that I know is real,
The Red Hots have baby appeal
They dig a funky speil, they'll make some speil
I say the Peppers have baby appeal
The funk mobile is the one we wheel
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal
We serve those tots in the funk mobile
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal, so get down!

Got the tunes in my pocket...
Baby appeal...
Rock out!...
Play the chili, play the chili, play the chili...
Yes, we're called the Red...Hots...

Hoo, Lord !

Well, I'm gonna ride a sabertooth horse
Through the Hollywood hills
The farther west, the farther out
Yeah, that's the way I feel
Well, I dig the dirt an' I dig the dust
I barbecue my meals

Ridin' wild on a paisley dragon
Through the Hollywood hills, yeah...
Huh, Hollywood hills

Well, I'm gonna ride a sabertooth horse
Through the Hollywood hills
Just don't show me anything

'cos that's the way I feel
Well, I dig the dirt an' I dig the dust
I barbecue my meals

Ridin' wild on a paisley dragon
Through the Hollywood hills, yeah...
Huh, Hollywood hills

Passion dripping from the coyote's eyes
He can taste his blood
An' blood never lies
Pale face die

True men don't kill coyotes

True men don't kill coyotes
