If you could see yourself now, baby,
It's not my fault, you used to be so in control.
You're going to roll right over this one.
Just roll me over, let me go,
You're laying blame.
Take this as no, no, no, no, no.

You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
Then blame, blame, blame,
You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
It's not my thing so let it go.

If you could see yourself now, baby,
The tables have turned, the whole world hinges on your swings,
Your secret life of indiscreet discretions.
I'd turn the screw and leave the screen,
Don't point your finger,
You know that's not my thing.

You came to bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
To blame, blame, blame,
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
It's not my thing so let it go now.

You've got a little worry,
I know it all too well.
I've got your number --
But so does every kiss and tell
Who dares to cross your threshold,
Or happens on you way,
Stop laying blame.
You know that's not my thing.

You know that's not my thing, you came to bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
Then blame, blame, blame.
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
It's not my thing so let it go, you
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
Then blame, blame, blame.
It's not my thing so let it go.

You kiss on me, 
Tug on me,
Rub on me, 
Jump on me.
You bang on me, 
Beat on me,
Hit on me,
Let go on me.
You let go on me.
Her world collapsed early Sunday morning
She got up from the kitchen table
Folded the newspaper and silenced the radio
Those creatures jumped the barricades
And have headed for the sea, sea

Those creatures jumped the barricades
And have headed for the sea
She began to breathe
To breathe at the thought of such freedom
Stood and whispered to her child, belong
She held the child and whispered
With calm, calm; belong

Stood and whispered to her child, belong
She held the child and whispered
With calm, calm; belong

These barricades can only hold for so long
Her world collapsed early Sunday morning
She took the child held tight
Opened the window
A breath, this song, how long
And knew, knew; belong
Here comes that awful feeling again
Welcome the ugly animal.
I hold my breath to watch you swing,
My high rope acrobat ball and chain,
I'm not afraid, I messed it, messed it, messed it, messed it up

I've got my telescope head in the haystack
I'm getting tired of your dodgeball circus act
Put pepper in my coffee, I forgot to bark on command

Here comes that awful feeling again
Make way for monster jealousy
The strong man kicked sand into my breakfast cereal bowl
I'd spelled your name with Oatios,
He messed it, messed it, messed it, messed it up

I've got my telescope head in the haystack
I am tired of your dodgeball circus act
Put pepper in my coffee, I forgot to bark on command

You're mean, mean, mean
You tease, tease, tease me

If I were you I'd really run from me
I'd really really wish that I were you
When I get loose I'll climb a tree
And drop a load on your head
This monster in me makes me retch, you messed it, messed it up

I've got my telescope head in the haystack
I am jealous of your dodgeball circus act
Put pepper in my coffee, I forgot to bark
Put pepper in my coffee, I forgot to bark on command

You're mean, mean, mean
You tease, tease, tease me

Do you smell jealousy?
Do you smell jealousy, jealousy, jealousy?
This flower is scorched, this film is on
On a maddening loop, these clothes
These clothes don't fit us right
I'm to blame
It's all the same
It's all the same

You come to me with a bone in your hand
You come to me with your hair curled tight
You come to me with positions

You come to me with excuses
Ducked out in a row
You wear me out
You wear me out

We've been through fake-a-breakdown
Self-hurt, plastics, collections
Self-help, self-pain
EST, psychics, fuck all

I was central, I had control
I lost my head
I need this, I need this

A paperweight, junk garage
Wedding ring, a honey pot
Crazy, all the lovers have been tagged

A hotline, a wanted ad
It's crazy what you could've had

It's crazy what you could've had
It's crazy what you could've had
I need this, I need this

It's crazy what you could've had
Crazy what you could've had
I need it, I need this

It's crazy what you could've had
It's crazy what you could've had
I need this, I, I need this

It's crazy what you could've had
I need this, I need this

It's crazy what you could've had
Crazy what you could've had
I need this, I need this

Crazy what you could've had
Crazy what you could've had
I know you
I know you've seen her
She's a sad tomato
She's three miles of bad road
Walking down the street
Will I never meet her?
She's a real woman-child
Oh my kiss breath turpentine

I am smitten
I'm the real thing (I'm the real thing)
Have you seen her come around?
My crush with eyeliner

I'm in like
I'm infatuated
It's all too much pressure
She's all that I can take
What position should I wear?
Cop an attitude? (You faker)
How can I convince her? (Faker)
That I'm invented, too, yeah

I am smitten
I'm the real thing (I'm the real thing)
We all invent ourselves
And you know me

She's a sad tomato
She's three miles of bad road
She's her own invention (She's her own invention)
That gets me in the throat
What can I make myself be?
Life is strange, yeah (Life is strange)
What can I make myself be? (Fake her)
To make her mine?

I am smitten
I'll do anything (I'll do anything)
A kiss breath turpentine
My crush with eyeliner

I am smitten
You know me (Yeah, you know me)
I could be your Frankenstein
My crush with eyeliner

I am smitten
I'm the real thing (I'm the real thing)
Won't you be my valentine?
My crush with eyeliner
Smack, crack, bushwhacked
Tie another one to your racks, baby
Hey kids, rock and roll
Nobody tells you where to go, baby

What if I ride, what if you walk?
What if you rock around the clock?
Tick-tock, tick-tock
What if you did, what if you walk?
What if you tried to get off, baby?

Hey, kids, where are you?
Nobody tells you what to do, baby
Hey kids, shake a leg
Maybe you're crazy in the head, baby

Maybe you did, maybe you walked
Maybe you rocked around the clock
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Maybe I ride, maybe you walk
Maybe I drive to get off, baby

Hey kids, shake a leg
Maybe you're crazy in the head, baby
Ollie, ollie, ollie ollie ollie
Ollie ollie in come free, baby

Hey, kids, where are you?
Nobody tells you what to do, baby

Smack, crack, shack-a-lack
Tie another one to your backs, baby
Hey kids, rock and roll
Nobody tells you where to go, baby

Maybe you did, maybe you walk
Maybe you rock around the clock
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Maybe I ride, maybe you walk
Maybe I drive to get off, baby

Hey kids, where are you?
Nobody tells you what to do, baby
Hey kids, rock and roll
Nobody tells you where to go, baby, baby, baby
When your day is long
And the night, the night is yours alone
When you're sure you've had enough
Of this life, well hang on

Don't let yourself go
'Cause everybody cries
And everybody hurts sometimes

Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone (Hold on, hold on)
If you feel like letting go (Hold on)
If you think you've had too much
Of this life, well hang on

Everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts
Don't throw your hand, oh no

Don't throw your hand
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you are not alone

If you're on your own in this life
The days and nights are long
When you think you've had too much of this life to hang on

Well, everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody cries
Everybody hurts sometimes
And everybody hurts sometimes

So hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Everybody hurts
Hey now, little speedyhead
The read on the speedmeter says
You have to go to task in the city

Where people drown and people serve
Don't be shy, your just deserve
Is only just light years to go

Me, my thoughts are flower strewn
Ocean storm, bayberry moon
I have got to leave to find my way

Watch the road and memorize
This life that pass before my eyes
Nothing is going my way

The ocean is the river's goal
A need to leave the water knows
We're closer now than light years to go

I have got to find the river
Bergamot and vetiver
Run through my head and fall away

Leave the road and memorize
This life that pass before my eyes
Nothing is going my way

There's no one left to take the lead
But I tell you and you can see
We're closer now than light years to go

Pick up here and chase the ride
The river empties to the tide
Fall into the ocean

The river to the ocean goes
A fortune for the undertow
None of this is going my way

There is nothing left to throw
Of Ginger, lemon, indigo
Coriander stem and rose of hay

Strength and courage overrides
The privileged and weary eyes
Of river poet search naivet√©

Pick up here and chase the ride
The river empties to the tide
All of this is coming your way
Sleep delays my life (get up, get up)
Where does time go? (get up, get up, get up)
I don't know

Sleep, sleep, sleepy head (get up, get up, get up)
Wake it up, up (get up, get up)
You've got all your life (way up ahead)
(Get up, get up, get up)

Dreams they complicate my life (Dreams they complement my life)
I've seen you laying pined (get up, get up)
I've seen you laying pined (get up, get up)

Life is rough, rough (get up, get up, get up)
I've seen you laying down (get up)
With the loving kind (get up, get up)
I know life is hard, hard (where goes your time?)
Where to turn? Where to turn? (get up)

Dreams they complicate my life (Dreams they compliment my life)
Dreamtime

Dreams they complicate my life (Dreams they compliment my life)
This time, no escape, I wake up (get up, get up)
(get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up)
I am not the type of dog
That could keep you waiting
For no good reason
Run a carbon-black test on my jaw
And you will find it's all been said before

I can swing my megaphone
And long arm the rest
It's easier and better
To just beat it from the chest
Of desire

I could walk into this room
And the waves of conversation are enough
To knock you down in the undertow
So alone, so alone in my life
Feed me banks of light
And hang your hairshirt on the lowest rung

It's a beautiful life
And I can hang my hairshirt
Away up high in the attic of
The wrong dog's life chest
Or bury it at sea
All my life I've searched for this 

Here I am, here I am
In your life
It's a beautiful life
My life
It's a beautiful life
Your life
This could be the saddest dusk I've ever seen
Turn to a miracle, high-alive
My mind is racing, as it always will
My hands tired, my heart aches
I'm half a world away here 
And I had sworn to go it alone, hold it along
And haul it along and hold it
Go it alone 'n hold it along
Hold

Oh, this lonely deeps and holy way
Half a world, half a world away
My shoes are gone, my life spent
I've had too much to drink
I didn't think, I didn't think of you
I guess that's all I needed
To go it alone and hold it along
And haul it along and hold it
Go it alone 'n hold it along
Hold

Oh, this lonely world is wasted
Pathetic eyes, high-alive
Blind eye that turns to see
The storm it came up strong
It shook the trees and blew away our fear
I couldn't leave it here
To go it alone, hold it along
Haul it along and hold it
Go it alone hold it along
Hold

Go it alone and hold it along
Haul it along 'n hold it
Blackbirds, backwards, forwards and fall
Hold

Oh, this could be the saddest dusk I've ever seen
Turn to a miracle, high-alive
My mind is racing, as it always will
My hands tired, my heart aches
I'm half a world away to go
I'm looking for an interruption,
do you believe?
You looking to dig my dreams
Be prepared for anything
You come into my little scene
Hooray hooray hip hip hooray
There's one thing I can guarantee:
You won't have to dig, dig too deep

Said leave me to lay, but touch me deep,
I don't sleep, I dream
I'll settle for a cup of coffee, but you know what I really need

Are you looking to drive my dreams?
You here to run my screens?
You come, deliver my demons
Hooray hooray hip hip hooray
Are you coming to ease my headache?
Do you give good head?
Am I good in bed?

I don't know, I guess so
I don't sleep, I dream
I'll settle for a cup of coffee, but you know what I really need

I'm looking for an interruption,
can you believe?
Some medicine for my headache
Hooray hooray hip hip hooray
I'm pitching for a new direction
Pinch me when I wake
Don't tell me my dreams are fake
you leave me to lay, you touch me deep,
I don't sleep, I dream
I'll settle for a cup of coffee, but you know what I really need
Leave me to lay, but touch me deep,
I don't sleep, I dream
I'll settle for a cup of coffee, but you know what I really need
These bastards stole their power from the victims of the Us v. 
Them years, wrecking all things virtuous and true.
The undermining social democratic downhill slide into abysmal
Lost lamb off the precipice into the trickle down runoff pool.

They hypnotized the summer, Nineteen seventy-nine.
Marched into the capital brooding duplicitous, wicked and able, media-ready,
Heartless, and labeled. Super U.S. citizen, super achiever, mega ultra power dosing. Relax.
Defense, defense, defense, defense. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ignoreland. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ignoreland. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

The information nation took their clues from all the sound-bite gluttons.
Nineteen eighty, eighty-four, eighty-eight, ninety-two too, too.
How to be what you can be, jump jam junking your energies.
How to walk in dignity with throw-up on your shoes

They amplified the autumn, nineteen seventy-nine.
Calculate the capital, up the republic my skinny ass.
TV tells a million lies. The paper's terrified to report
Anything that isn't handed on a presidential spoon,
I'm just profoundly frustrated by all this. So, fuck you, man. (Fuck 'em)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ignoreland. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ignoreland. 
If they weren't there we would have created them. Maybe, it's true,
But I'm resentful all the same. Someone's got to take the blame.
I know that this is vitriol. No solution, spleen-venting,
But I feel better having screamed. Don't you?

They desecrated winter, nineteen seventy-nine.
Capital collateral. Brooding duplicitous, wicked and able, media-ready,
Heartless, and labeled. Super U.S. citizen, super achiever, mega ultra power dosing. Relax.
Defense, defense, defense, defense. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ignoreland. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ignoreland.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ignoreland. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I remember redwood trees, bumper cars and wolverines
The ocean's Trident submarines
Lemons, limes and tangerines
I remember this

I remember traffic jams
Motor boys and girls with tans
Nearly was and almost rans
I remember this

History is made
History is made to seem unfair

I recall that you were there
Golden smile and shining hair
I recall it wasn't fair
Recollect it wasn't fair
Remembering it wasn't fair outside

Low ebb, high tide
The lowest ebb and highest tide
A symbol wave I must confide
I guess we took us for a ride
I guess it's just a gesture

I remember this defense
Progress fails pacific sense
All those sweet conspiracies
I remember all these things

I remember traffic jams
Motor boys and girls with tans
Nearly was and almost rans
I remember this, this

Low ebb, high tide
The lowest ebb and highest tide
I guess we took us for a ride
I guess its just a gesture.

At the end of the continent
At the edge of the continent
I wore the clothes you wanted
I took your name
If there is some confusion, who's to blame?

I signed your living will
I smiled your face
I'm ready to close the book on NASA in outer space

If there is some confusion
Who's to blame?
Who's to blame?

I sequenced your arrival
I sealed your fate
I pushed the button and erased your master tape

I wrote the sales pitch
I threw the brake switch
I dragged your big ass daddy roth car out of that ditch

If there is some confusion
Who's to blame?
Who's to blame?

I crossed your great divide
I stirred your ocean's tide
I called your bluff until I blew your circuits wide

I'll be your albatross,
Devil, dog, Jesus, god,
I don't wanna be Iggy Pop but if that's what it takes, hey

If there is some confusion
If there is some confusion
If there is some confusion
Who's to blame?
Who's to blame?
Make your money with a suit and tie
Make your money with shrewd denial
Make your money expert advice,
If you can wing it
Make your money with a power ply
Make your money with a buyout bribe
You can lie as long as you mean it

I'm not king of comedy,
Grease the pig, give a squeeze (squeeze me)

Make your money with exploitation
Make it holy illumination
Say a prayer at every station
Don't forget to ask for mercy
Make your money with a pretty face
Make it easy with product placement
Make it charged with controversy
I'm straight, I'm queer, I'm bi

I'm not king of comedy,
I'm not your magazine,
I'm not your television

Make your money, make it rich
make it young and make it quick
Make your money on the jukebox, baby,
it's pick up sticks,
Make your enemies make your moves
Make your critics fumble through
Make it smart and make it schmooze
Make it look easy

I'm not king of comedy,
I'm not your magazine,
I'm not your television,
I'm not your movie screen
I'm not commodity (all together now)
I'm not commodity
I'm not commodity
Yeah all those stars drip down like butter
And promises are sweet
We hold out our pans with our hands to catch them
We eat them up, drink them up, up, up, up

Heyyyyyyyyyyy, let me in
Heyyyyyyyyyyy, let me in

I only wish that I could hear you whisper down,
Mister fisherman, to a less peculiar ground
He gathered up his loved ones and he brought them all around
To say goodbye, 
Nice try.

Heyyyyyyyyyyy, let me in
Yeah yeah yeah
Heyyyyyyyyyyy, let me in

I had a mind to try to stop you
Let me in. Let me in
Well, I got tar on my feet and I can't see all the birds look down and laugh at me
Clumsy, crawling out of my skin

Heyyyyyyyyyyy, let me in
Yeah yeah yeah
Heyyyyyyyyyyy, let me in

Heyyyyyyyyyyy, let me in 
Yeah yeah yeah
Heyyyyyyyyyyy, let me in
Oh life, it's bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper
Of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this
Consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this, the slip
That brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come
Flailing around
Now I've said too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why try
That was just a dream
Just a dream
Just a dream, dream
Dusk is dawn is day
Where did it go?
I've been laughing
Fast and slow

Moving in a still frame
Howling at the moon
Morning found me laughing
Up and down, down

Low, low, low
Night suits me fine
And morning suits me fine
I've been so happy, happy
Way up high, high

In between
Down below
Low, low, low
Low, low, low

I skipped the part about love
It seems so silly and low
Low, low, low
Low, low, low

I said the morning
It isn't your time
Barefoot naked
I can see your lines

It doesn't bother me
If you are right
Your grass is grassy wet
Your light white is bright
Light white, light

I skipped the part about love
It seems so shallow and low
Low, low, low
Low, low, low

You and me
We know about time
We know how things go
They come and go
They live and grow
They pass and go
And glow and glow
Up and down
High and low
Low, low, low
Low, low, low

I skipped the part about love
It seems so silly and low
I skipped the part about love
It seems so shallow and low
Low, low, low
Low, low, low

I like your hands
All full of glory
All full of glory

I sat there looking ugly, looking ugly and mean
I knew what you were saying, you were saying to me
Baby's got some new rules
Baby said she's had it with me

It seems a shame to waste your time on me
It seems a lot to waste your time for me
Left me to love
What it's doing to me

There's a lot of honey in this world
Baby this honey's from me
You've got to do what you do
Do it with me

It seems a shame to waste your time for me
Left me to love
What it's doing to me

Knocked silly, knocked flat, sideways down
These things they pick you up and they turn you around
Say your piece
Say you're sweet for me

It's all the same to share the pain with me
It's all the same, save the shame for me
Left me to love
What it's doing to me

Baby's got some new rules
Baby says she's had it with me
There's a fly in the honey
And baby's got a baby with me
That's a part, that's a part of me

Left me to love
What it's doing to me
Left me to love
What it's doing to me

What about me?
What about me?
Monty this seems strange to me.
The movies had that movie thing,
But nonsense has a welcome ring
And heroes don't come easily.
Now, nonsense isn't new to me.
I know my head, I know my feet,
But mischief knocked me in the knees.
Said, Just let go. Just let go.

I saw the ocean meet the man.
I saw you buried in the sand.
A friend was there to hold your hand,
Said, Walk on by.
So, I went walking through the street.
I saw you strung up in a tree.
A woman knelt there said to me,
Said, Hold your tongue, man. Hold your tongue. 

You don't owe me anything.
You don't want this sympathy. (waste your breath)
Don't you waste your breath. (waste your breath)
For the silver screen.

That nonsense doesn't mean a thing,
They tried to bust you in a sting,
But virtue isn't everything
So, don't waste time.
Now, here's a rhyme that you can steal.
Put this on your reel to reel.
Mischief threw a rotten deal.
Monty's laying low.
He is laying low.
Just let go, just let go.

You don't owe me anything.
You don't want this sympathy. (waste your breath)
Don't you waste your breath. (waste your breath)
Monty this seems strange to me.
Whenever we hold each other
We hold each other
There's a feeling that's gone
Something has gone wrong

And I don't know how much longer I can take it
House made of heart, break it
Take my head in your hands and shake it
In this near wild heaven
Not near enough

(Inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven

(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven

Whatever it takes I'm giving
It's just a gift I'm given
Try to live inside
Trying to move inside

And I always thought that it would make me smarter
But it's only made me harder
My heart thrown open wide
In this near wild heaven
Not near enough

(Inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven

(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven

(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven

(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven

I'm holding my hands together
Holding my feet together
Holding myself together
In this near wild heaven
Not near enough

Near wild heaven
Near wild heaven

(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven

(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven

(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven

(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven
Nightswimming deserves a quiet night

The photograph on the dashboard taken years ago,
turned around backwards so the windshield shows.
Every street light reveals a picture in reverse
Still it's so much clearer

I forgot my shirt at the water's edge
The moon is low tonight

Nightswimming deserves a quiet night
I'm not sure all these people understand
It's not like years ago
The fear of getting caught
The recklessness in water
They cannot see me naked
These things they go away
Replaced by every day

Nightswimming, 
remembering that night
September's coming soon
I'm pining for the moon
And what if there were two
Side by side in orbit around the fairest sun?
The bright tide forever drawn 
Could not describe nightswimming

You, I thought I knew you
You, I cannot judge
You, I thought you knew me
This one laughing quietly
Underneath my breath
Nightswimming

The photograph reflects
Every street light a reminder
Nightswimming
Deserves a quiet night
Deserves a quiet night
(Follow me, don't follow me)
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
(Collar me, don't collar me)
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
(We are agents of the free)
I've had my fun and now it's time to serve your conscience overseas
(Over me, not over me)
Coming in fast, over me (oh, oh)

(Follow me, don't follow me)
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
(Collar me, don't collar me)
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
(We are agents of the free)
I've had my fun and now it's time to serve your conscience overseas
(Over me, not over me)
Coming in fast, over me (oh, oh)

High on the booze
In a tent
Paved with blood
Nine inch howl
Brave the night
Chopper comin' in, you hope

We would circle and we'd circle and we'd circle to stop and consider and centered on the pavement stacked up all the trucks jacked up and our wheels in slush and orange crush in pocket and all this here county, hell, any county, it's just like heaven here, and I was remembering and I was just in a different county and all then this whirlybird that I headed for I had my goggles pulled off; I knew it all, I knew every back road and every truck stop

(Follow me, don't follow me)
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
(Collar me, don't collar me)
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
(We are agents of the free)
I've had my fun and now it's time to serve your conscience overseas
(Over me, not over me)
Coming in fast, over me (oh, oh)

High on the booze
In a tent
Paved with blood
Nine inch howl
Brave the night
Chopper comin' in, you hope

High on the booze
In a tent
Paved with blood
Nine inch howl
Brave the night
Chopper comin' in, you hope

(Ah, oh)
Hello, I saw you, I know you, I knew you
I think I can remember your name (name)
Hello, I'm sorry, I lost myself
I think I thought you were someone else

Should we talk about the weather?
(Hi, hi, hi)
Should we talk about the government?
(Hi, hi, hi, hi)

Hello, how are you? I know you, I knew you
I think I can remember your name, name
Hello, I'm sorry I lost myself
I think I thought you were someone else

Should we talk about the weather?
(Hi, hi, hi)
Should we talk about the government?
(Hi, hi, hi, hi)

Hello my friend, are you visible today?
You know I never knew that it could be so strange, strange
Hello, I'm sorry, I lost myself
I think I thought you were someone else

Should we talk about the weather?
(Hi, hi, hi)
Should we talk about the government?
(Hi, hi, hi, hi)

(Hi, hi)
(Hi, hi, hi)
(Hi, hi)
(Hi, hi, hi)

Hey, I can't find nothing on the radio
Yo! turn to that station

The world is collapsing
Around our ears
I turned up the radio
But I can't hear it

When I got to the house
And I called you out
I could tell that you had been crying, crying
It's that same sing song on the radio
It makes me sad

I meant to turn it off
To say goodbye
To leave in quiet, that radio song
Hey, hey, hey (ha ha)

I've everything to show (everything to show)
I've everything to hide (everything to hide)
Look into my eyes
Listen

When I got to the show
Yo ho ho
I could tell that you had been crying, crying
It's that same sing song, and the DJ sucks
It makes me sad

I tried to turn it off (turn it off)
To say goodbye my love
That radio song
Hey, hey, hey

The world is collapsing
Around our ears
I turned up the radio
But I can't hear it

Yeah, baby, baby, baby

I tried to sing along
But damn that radio song
Hey hey hey

I've everything to show (everything to show)
I've everything to hide (everything to hide)
Look into my eyes
Listen to the radio

I turned up the radio
But I can't hear it
No, I can't hear it

Hey, hey, hey
Say what?
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Say what?
Hey, hey, hey

Check it out
What are you saying?
What are you playing?
Who are you obeying?
Day out, day in, huh?
Baby, baby, baby
That stuff is driving me crazy
DJs communicate to the masses
Sex and violent classes
Now our children grow up prisoners
All their life- radio listeners
Shiny happy people laughing

Meet me in the crowd, people, people
Throw your love around, love me, love me
Take it into town, happy, happy
Put it in the ground where the flowers grow 
Gold and silver shine

Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people laughing 

Everyone around, love them, love them
Put it in your hands, take it, take it
There's no time to cry, happy, happy
Put it in your heart where tomorrow shines
Gold and silver shine

You don't have to take the bar exam to see
What you've done is ignoramus 103
What've I got to hang my hat on
You don't have a pot to pee in
All this just to be your friend
I was there until the end.
Extortion and arson, petty larceny.

I know you called-I know you called-I know you called
I know you called-I know you called-I know you hung up my line
Star 69

I know all about the warehouse fire
I know squirrelys didn't chew the wires
3 people have my number
The other 2 were with me
I don't like to tell-tell but i'm not your patsy.
This time you have gone too far with me.

I know you called-I know you called-I know you called
I know you called-I know you called-I know you hung up my line
Star 69

Why'd you put your quarter down on me?
This reads like some dork inside edition hard copy.
I can't be your character witness
I can't be your alibi
Doorbell rings it's the FBI
We learned Spy vs. Spy
You my friend are guilty as can be.

I know you called-I know you called-I know you called
I know you called-I know you called-I know you hung up my line
I know you called-I know you called-I know you called
I know you called-I know you called-I can't be your alibi
Star 69
Keys cut, three for the price of one
And nothing's free, but guaranteed for a lifetime's use
I've changed the locks, and you can't have one
You, you know the other two

The brakes have worn so thin that you could hear
I hear them screeching through the door from our driveway
Hey, love, look into your glovebox heart
What is there for me inside, this love is tired
I've changed the locks, have I misplaced you?

Have we lost our minds?
Will this never end?
It could depend on your take

You, me, we used to be on fire
If keys are all that stand between
Can I throw in the ring?
No gasoline, just fuck me, kitten
You are wild, and I'm in your possession
Nothing's free, so fuck me, kitten

I'm in your possession
So fuck me, kitten
I don't know why you're mean to me
when I call on the telephone.
and I don't know what you mean to me
but I want to turn you on, turn you up, figure you out, I want to take you on

These words, &quot;You will be mine.&quot;
These words, &quot;You will be mine.&quot; all the time.

The fool might be my middle name
But I'd be foolish not to say
I'm going to make whatever it takes,
bring you up, call you down, sign your name, secret love,
make it rhyme, take you in, and make you mine.

These words, &quot;You will be mine.&quot;
These words, &quot;You will be mine.&quot; all the time. oh

I tripped and fell, and did I fall.
What I want to feel, I want to feel it now

You know with love come strange currencies
and here is my appeal:

I need a chance, a second chance, a third chance, a fourth chance,
a word, a signal, a nod, a little breath
just to fool myself, to catch myself, to make it real, real

These words, &quot;You will be mine&quot;
These words, &quot;You will be mine.&quot; all the time. oh

These words, &quot;You will be mine.&quot;
These words, they haunt me, hunt me down, catch in my throat, make me pray,
say, love's confined, on Earth
Readying to bury your father and your mother
What did you think when you lost another?
I used to wonder, why did you bother?
Distanced from one, blind to the other

Listen here my sister and my brother
What would you care if you lost the other?
I always wonder, why did we bother?
Distanced from one, blind to the other

Oh, but sweetness follows

It's these little things, they can pull you under
Live your life filled with joy and wonder
I always knew this altogether thunder
Was lost in our little lives

Oh, but sweetness follows
Oh, but sweetness follows

It's these little things, they can pull you under
Live your life filled with joy and thunder
Yeah, yeah we were altogether
Lost in our little lives

Oh, but sweetness follows
Oh, but sweetness follows
20,000 miles to an oasis
20,000 years will I burn
20,000 chances I've wasted
Waiting for the moment to turn

I would give my life to find it
I would give it all
Catch me if I fall

Walking through the woods, I have faced it
Looking for something to learn
30,000 thoughts have been wasted
Never in my time to return

I would give my life to find it
I would give it all
Catch me if I fall

All my life
Waiting to find

40,000 stars in the evening
Look at them fall from the sky
40,000 reasons for living
40,000 tears in your eyes

I would give my life to find it
I would give it all
Catch me if I fall

Catch me if I fall, catch me if I fall
Catch me if I fall, catch me if I fall
Catch me if I fall, catch me if I fall
Catch me if I fall, catch me if I fall
Catch me if I fall, catch me if I fall
This here is the place where I will be staying
There isn't a number, you can call the pay phone
Let it ring a long, long, long, long time
If I don't pick up, hang up, call back, let it ring some more, oh
If I don't pick up, pick up
The sidewinder sleeps, sleeps, sleeps in a coil

Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her, oh

There are scratches all around the coin slot
Like a heartbeat, baby trying to wake up
But this machine can only swallow money
You can't lay a patch by computer design
It's just a lot of stupid, stupid signs

Tell her
Tell her she can kiss my ass
Then laugh and say that you were only kidding
That way she'll know that it's really, really, really, really me

Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her, oh

Baby, instant soup doesn't really grab me
Today I need something more sub-sub-sub-substantial
A can of beans or black-eyed peas, some Nescafe and ice
A candy bar, a falling star, or a reading from Doctor Seuss

Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her, oh

The cat in the hat came back, wrecked a lot of havoc on the way
Always had a smile and a reason to pretend
But their world has flat backgrounds and little need to sleep but to dream
The sidewinder sleeps on his back

Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
I can always sleep standing up. Call me when you try to wake her, oh

Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
I can always sleep standing up. Call me when you try to wake her, oh

Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
I can always sleep standing up. Call me when you try to wake her, oh

We've got to moogie, moogie, move on this one
I've watched the children come and go
A late long march into spring
I sit and watch those children
Jump in the tall grass
Leap the sprinkler
Walk in the ground
Bicycle clothespin spokes
The sound, the smell of swingset hands

I will try to sing a happy song
I'll try and make a happy game to play

Come play with me I whispered to my new found friend
Tell me what it's like to go outside
I've never been
Tell me what it's like to just go outside
I've never been
And I never will

And I'm not supposed to be like this
I'm not supposed to be like this
But it's okay

Hey those kids are looking at me
I told my friend myself
Those kids are looking at me
They're laughing and they're running over here
They're laughing and they're running over here

What do I do?
What can I do?
What should I do?
What do I say?
What can I say?

I said I'm not supposed to be like this
Let's try to find a happy game to play
Let's try to find a happy game to play

I'm not supposed to be like this
But it's okay, okay
Call my name, here I come.
90 to nothing, watch me run.
You call.
I am ashamed to say.
Ugly girls know their fate.
Anybody can get laid.
You want a room with a fire escape.
I wanna tell you how much I hate this.
Don't leave that stuff all over me. It pains me.
Please just leave it.
I should toss that vanity license plate.
Toss that make-up painted face.
Box those poems, chocolate cake.
Scratch that name on the record player.
Please just leave me be.
Don't lay that stuff all over me.
It crawls all over. All over me.
Call my name, here I come.
Your last ditch lay, will I never learn?
Caramel turn on a dusty apology.
It crawls all over me.
You turn all over.
It pains me.
Please just leave it.
I will try not to breathe.
I can hold my head still with my hands at my knees.
These eyes are the eyes of the old, shiver and fold. 
I will try not to breathe.
This decision is mine. I have lived a full life
And these are the eyes that I want you to remember. Oh.

I need something to fly over my grave again.
I need something to breathe.
I will try not to burden you.
I can hold these inside. I will hold my breath
Until all these shivers subside,
Just look in my eyes.

I will try not to worry you.
I have seen things that you will never see.
Leave it to memory me. I shudder to breathe.
I want you to remember. Oh. (you will never see)
I need something to fly (something to fly)
Over my grave again. (you will never see)

I need something to breathe. (something to breathe)
Baby, don't shiver now.
Why do you shiver now? (I will see things you will never see)
I need something to fly (something to fly)
Over my grave again. (I will see things you will never see)
I need something to breathe. Oh. Oh. Oh.

I will try not to worry you.
I have seen things that you will never see.
Leave it to memory me. Don't dare me to breathe.
I want you to remember. Oh. (you will never see)
I need something to fly (something to fly)
Over my grave again. (you will never see)

I need something to breathe. (something to breathe)
Baby, don't shiver now.
Why do you shiver now? (I will see things you will never see)
I need something to breathe. (something to breathe - I have seen things you will never see)
I want you to remember.
Divide your cultured pearls and paste
I'm looking for to lay to waste
Of all the things I cannot taste
And this not the racy race

They spoke loud,
&quot;I believe in what you do
I believe in watching you&quot;
It's what you do
&quot;I believe in what you do
I believe in watching you&quot;

I could turn you inside-out
What I choose not to do
I could turn you inside-out
What I choose not to do

Given the choice
Given the heart
Given the tool
Given the word
Given the cheers

&quot;I believe in what you do
I believe in watching you&quot;
It's what you do
&quot;I believe in what you do
I believe in watching you&quot;

I could I, I could turn you inside-out
What I choose not to do
I could turn you inside-out
What I choose not to do

Given the choice
Given the heart
Given the tool
Given the word
Given the cheers
This world is big (this world is big)
And so awake (and so awake)
I stayed up late (I stayed up late)
To hear your voice

This light is here (this light is here)
To keep you warm (to keep you warm)
This song is here (this song is here)
To keep you strong

(I made a list) I made a list
(Of things to say) of things to say
But all I want to say (but all I want)
All I really want to say is (yes, all I want)

(I made a list) hold her
(Of things to say) and keep him strong
(But all I want) while I'm away
(Yes, all I want) from here

(This world is big) hold her
(And so alone) and keep her strong
(I stayed up late) while I'm away
(To hear your voice) from here

(This light is here) hold him
(To keep you warm) and him strong
(This song is here) while I'm away
(To keep you strong) from here

I've seen the world and so awake
(Keep him strong)
And stay up late to hear me sing
Just hold her
I've seen the world and so awake
(Keep him strong)
And stay up late to hear me sing
Just hold him

(I've seen the world) hold her
(And so awake) and keep her strong
(So stay awake) while I'm away
(To hear me sing) from here
(I've seen the world) hold him
(And so awake) and keep her strong
(So stay awake) while I'm away
(To hear me sing) from here
&quot;What's the frequency, Kenneth?&quot; is your Benzedrine, uh-huh
I was brain-dead, locked out, numb, not up to speed
I thought I'd pegged you an idiot's dream
Tunnel vision from the outsider's screen
I never understood the frequency, uh-huh
You wore our expectations like an armored suit, uh-huh 

I'd studied your cartoons, radio, music, TV, movies, magazines
Richard said, &quot;Withdrawal in disgust is not the same as apathy&quot;
A smile like the cartoon, tooth for a tooth
You said that irony was the shackles of youth
You wore a shirt of violent green, uh-huh
I never understood the frequency, uh-huh 

&quot;What's the frequency, Kenneth?&quot; is your Benzedrine, uh-huh
Butterfly decal, rear-view mirror, dogging the scene
You smile like the cartoon, tooth for a tooth
You said that irony was the shackles of youth
You wore a shirt of violent green, uh-huh
I never understood the frequency, uh-huh 

You wore our expectations like an armored suit, uh-huh
I couldn't understand
You said that irony was the shackles of youth, uh-huh
I couldn't understand
You wore a shirt of violent green, uh-huh
I couldn't understand
I never understood, don't fuck with me, uh-huh
I sit at my table and wage war on myself
It seems like it's all, it's all for nothing
I know the barricades
And I know the mortar in the wall breaks
I recognise the weapons, I've used them well

This is my mistake
Let me make it good
I raised the wall
And I will be the one to knock it down

I've a rich understanding of my finest defences
I proclaim that claims are left unstated
I demand a rematch

I decree a stalemate
I divine my deeper motives
I recognise the weapons
I've practised them well
I fitted them myself

It's amazing what devices you can sympathize
Empathise
This is my mistake, let me make it good
I raised the wall
And I will be the one to knock it down

Reach out for me
Hold me tight
Hold that memory
Let my machine talk to me
Let my machine talk to me

This is my world,and I am the World Leader Pretend
This is my life, and this is my time
I have been given the freedom to do as I see fit
It's high time I razed the walls that I've constructed

It's amazing what devices you can sympathize
Empathise
This is my mistake, let me make it good
I raised the wall
And I will be the one to knock it down

You fill in the mortar
You fill in the harmony
You fill in the mortar
I raised the wall
And I'm the only one
I will be the one to knock it down
Let the sun beat through the clouds,
Let me kiss you on the mouth.
All my childhood toys with chew marks in your smile.
Let me hold your syrup close to mine.
Let me watch you, Hollywood and Vine.
And I want you like the movies, touch me now.
I love you crazy, just keep on.
I love you madly, just keep watch.
You wipe my lips,
You turn me on.
My attentions are turned to you.

Did I dream you were a tourist
In the Arizona sun?
I can see you there with luna moths
And watermelon gum.
I woke up in the sleeping bag,
With nowhere else to run.
You're standing in the bathroom
Telling me its all in fun.
I love you crazy, just keep on.
I love you madly, just keep watch.
You wipe my lips,
You turn me on.
My attentions are turned to you.

I can whisper in your ear.
I can write a calendar year
I can wing around your Saturn smile, shout at the moon
I walked the tension wire line.
And I learned to disrespect the signs.
And I want you like a Pisces rising, even though
I love you crazy, just keep on.
I love you madly, just keep watch.
You wipe my lips,
You turn me on.
My attentions are turned to you.
Sometimes I feel like I can't even sing (say, say, the light)
I'm very scared for this world
I'm very scared for me
Eviscerate your memory
Here's a scene
You're in the back seat laying down
The windows wrap around
To sound of the travel and the engine

All you hear is time stand still in travel
And feel such peace and absolute
The stillness still that doesn't end
But slowly drifts into sleep
The stars are the greatest thing you've ever seen
And they're there for you
For you alone you are the everything

I think about this world a lot and I cry
And I've seen the films and the eyes
But I'm in this kitchen
Everything is beautiful
And she is so beautiful
She is so young and old
I look at her and I see the beauty
Of the light of music

The voices talking somewhere in the house
Late spring and you're drifting off to sleep
With your teeth in your mouth
You are here with me
You are here with me
You have been here and you are everything

Sometimes I feel like I can't even sing (say, say, the light)
I'm very scared for this world
I'm very scared for me
Eviscerate your memory
Here's a scene
You're in the back seat laying down
The windows wrap around (say, say, the light)
To sound of the travel and the engine

All you hear is time stand still in travel
And feel such peace and absolute
The stillness still that doesn't end
But slowly drifts into sleep
The greatest thing you've ever seen
And they're there for you
For you alone you are the everything
